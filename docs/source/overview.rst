Overview
=========

This project provides an architecture and some key algorithms to control quadruped robots, including state estimator, gait generator, stance and swing leg controllers. 

The project now supports A1 robot (Unitree-Robotics) and Lite2A robot (Deep-Robotics). This project can be easily extended to support other quadruped robots such as AlienGO/GO1 (Unitree-Robotics), Jueying/X20(Deep-Robotics) and Anymal.
